Awesome!. You are in the right place _ while millions of VR enthusiasts don't follow my content yet, <b>that is my goal yet</b>.<br><br>

<h3>A little about me</h3><br>

Hey, <a href="">Chelsea Koby</a> here... <br>

I started ChelOverboard in 2020, as a place to write about everything I learn in VR. My goal is this - as I learn about VR Development on Unity, teach beginner folks what I know to save time on their side and get them in action faster. that was fine at first ... You know, but then ofc I love other aspects of VR, like learning about research and breakthroughs (it makes me inspired and more imaginative), therefore I created a news section to break down VR news around so other folks can be more imaginative üòå. <br><br>

One more thing, I'm super focused on the practical side of things (what the fuck can I do with this shit ü§ê). So, Yeh, I'm gonna teach you how to make a VR Game prototype in like what?... ... 1 week!. If you haven't already, visit here to start <a href="">Build a VR Game</a>. <br><br>


<h3>Some quick facts about me </h3>
<ul>
  <li>I love sports, specifically "European" football. Messi team for life! </li>
  <li>I built my first website when I was 16 - too old?. I'm ashamed too, but now were buddies.</li>
  <li>My best video game of all time is - Brawl Stars. </li>
  <li>Apart from blogging, I'm a front-end developer, programming tutor and computer vision engineer. My full profile is after (a little about me)</li>
</ul>


ChelOverboard is a project I've poured my heart into - I sincerely hope I can reach more people to share my knowledge with, and I can't wait to see what you'll accomplish with what you learn here. One thing is constant - A playable VR experience, the rest though depends on you üôÉ. <br><br>

Now, let's make the magic happen. <br><br>

Thanks and talk soon, <br><br>
