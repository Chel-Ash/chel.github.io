    <p class="resources-body">Hello and welcome! If you want to become an expert in AI or gain knowledge on ML, you need a go-to list of hand picked Machine Learning tools and resources to help you achieve your goals. The good news is: you'll find anything you need online.But its time consuming to find those perfect tools that give you the highest improvement. <br><br>
    To help you save time and efforts, I'm sharing all the tools and resources that I have used and currently using to build myself in Artificial Intelligence and related fields.<br><br>
      
    Go ahead and take a look around! You'll find heaps of helpful tools like courses and libraries and my favourite Machine Learning models creation tool that would help kick-start your journey in mastering AI.<br><br></p>

     <p class="resources-list">1: PROGRAMMING HUB</p>  
        
        <p class="resources-body"><a href="">Programming Hub</a> is an android app that has an interactive design for courses. Their courses range from Computer Networks to Python programming language to even Artificial Intelligence. Why I chose this for you to begin you journey in Artificial Intelligence an ML mastering is that it provides the most basic way in which you can get a good grasp of Python, which you'll need to program models in most frameworks and Artificial Intelligence, the subject or super-set covering its inner field. I recommend you take two courses there namely Python 3 and Artificial Intelligence. If you already have a good understanding of Python, you can skip it and move on to the next course indicated.<br><br></p>

    <p class="resources-list">2: SOLO-LEARN</p>       
        <p class="resources-body"><a href="">Sololearn</a> is another android application that offers great courses covering Programming languages and web development courses. It's main deifference from programming hub is that it give more logical explanation on the syntax of code, Programming hub is good at this too of-course but sololearn delves deeper into logical code aspects. You also receive verified certificates after the completion of each course like in Programming Hub. I recommend you take the Python 3 Courses available ,that is, if you don't have knowledge of it, and also the Machine Learning Course that would brush up the main concepts of ML in a simplified way before moving on to bigger and deeper concepts of the specialization.<br><br></p>
