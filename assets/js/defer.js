I offer you in this service Machine Learning Models that are specific to your needs and businesses.  I would build models for you as required and deploy it for production as an API or any other Integration method. I'm have experience building models with Tensorflow Framework, serving with API endpoint. Apart from that, if you need a different structure, rest assured I can find solutions for them. I make sure to discuss with you the best approach that should be taken. 



PROJECT DESCRIPTION;

To make it easier for you to understand what this service offers, take a look at a typical project I can build for client.



Note: This is not limited to the projects I can work on, It's only a simple example for your understanding.



You want an Image Classification Model that can make very accurate predictions on new images. This model is deployed as the back-end of  your web-application and Users can upload images and it identifies the Image class. 



You want to build a classification Model specific for your business or Industry. 



In Manufacturing: To filter defects items from production-ready ones
In Agriculture:  To detect early on when crops are susceptible to diseases.
In Medical: To assist medical practitioners accurately predict X-ray scans for when a patient has signs of cancer (any other illness)

All these examples can be easily integrated in a Mobiles for ease-of-use. 



Taking a look at my skills should provide better understanding of the generals covered in this service.


Hello, saw the descriptions of your job postings and I see it as something in my field of work and which my current skills can bring results to.  I've worked on a few projects using frameworks and although nothing quite similar to yours, from my understanding I see it as something that can be easily achieved with a ML framework as you would need real-time improvements.  I did work on something similar but using traditional Machine Learning Algorithms, this was during one of my projects while taking a Stanford University ML online course. I don't propose using traditional methods though, ML frameworks libraries would be the go-to for this task. In my posted CV, some links are available where you can take a look at some of my work. I would love to collaborate with your team on this and develop the system you desire. Thanks Chel


Hello Fatou.co, I saw your job posting on Indeed and I'm applying for it as a high-school qualifications is allowed which is great. I think I can be of value to the company mainly in the area of finding business patterns and building models that would improve productivity. i did add some certifications of some courses I've taken but those are not the basis of my application. i've had practice with the skills I gathered from the online courses and I just started implementing projects in those areas. I have some experience with Tensorflow and I can build simple CV models with it. In my CV some links are available to some projects that I have implemented with Tensorflow. I would love to be a part of your team no matter the position . My area of interest is Machine learning and CV. It might not be exactly what you are looking for but I'm very open minded and can learn new skills that fit my situation very well.
