  "articleBody" : "You'll come across the word CNNs the most often while studying Artificial Intelligence and its related fields. BUT... What exactly are CNNs and how are they applied.  Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of Deep Learning Algorithm that are used to train models to acheive binary classification. What this tells you is that, there are different types of Deep Learning Algorithms that in turn have different purposes,that is, what are they used for. Towards the end of the post, the currently in use types and their application will be listed to help you gain more insights but it takes a few courses to really understand them.  The question: What is Binary Classification then pops up  Binary Classification is an algorithm that is used to train Neural Networks to exhibit recognition of objects. In most cases, it is usually applied to learn models for image recognition or Photo tagging that is used in applications and software. Consequently, we know that CNNs are used for Image or Object classification.A very simple and popular example would be an application that is used to recognise photos of cats or dogs,that is, it is capable of picking out a cot from a group of animals. Of all the Neural Networks types currently known, CNNs are the most popular and have the highest application in AI,Technological and business sectors. Some of their applictions includes:  Photo Tagging: The use of software or application like in social media to recognize images for tag predictions or recommendations to users  Image Recognition: The use of applications to categorize objects or images into their class which can be valuable as it saves time and human workforce is reduced  Computer Vision: This is a relatively new application of CNNs and is one of the more complicated scenarios; involves installation of models into devices that can recognize objects around it and therefore be able to interact with it. For one has to make sense of an item, to be able to know what to use it for.  Security: Simply using the image recognition CNNs offer to set restrictions on certain documents or software to only be accessibel to a set of people  Manufacturing: Lastly, you can find the application of CNNs in production line. Many Production & Manufacturing Industries now use CNNs for Products and Produce inspection before commencement to the next stage of Production. These are but a few of the many applications of CNNs, you now have a glimpse of their inherent popularity.  Below I'll now list the differnt types of Neural Networks (NN) and their respective applications:  Types\tInput(x)\tOutput(y)\tApplication Standard NNs\tHome Features\tPrice\tReal Estate Convolutional NNs\tImage\tObject Recognition\tPhoto tagging Recurrent NNs\tAudio\tText Transcript\tSpeech Recognition Hybrid NNs\tRader info\tPositioning\tAutonomous driving  That brings us to the end of this post. I really hope I've opened your understanding to a few things considering CNNs and Deep Learning in general.",
