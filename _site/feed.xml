You want to make beautiful games, you are confident of your creative abilities, one little hitch though - you have no idea where to start, what to use, or even why to use them. In this tutorial, i drastically simplify the entire process in my most preferred way of communication - layman terms. Are you with me?, well, then Read On!.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Selecting Unity VR Plugin for VR Dev&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feedback&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-are-vr-sdksplugins&quot;&gt;What are VR SDKs/Plugins?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: This post is focused on implementation with the Unity 3d engine as it is best suited for beginners (from experience). if by chance, you heart lies with Unreal, worry not, the plugins name can be easily tewaked for Unreal Engine. You would understand better my meaning as we progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have no doubt heard constantly about VR Sdks and plugins. As a beginner to Vr development, perhaps with no previous experience with APIs and Plugins, these terms might all seem very strange and confusing to you. The good news for you is that it shouldn’t anymore after reading this article, my goal is to simplify the idea around them in simple words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VR Sdks (Virtual Reality Software Developement Kits) are a collection of scripts (Long gist of Codes), prefabs, components, and packages, i.e all accumulated into one single Unity “Asset” - the purpose being to make the building of VR experiences easier for the end user. Let’s take a different perspective to understand better;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Virtual reality Game or Experience, We (Users) can involve in a lot of basic to advanced interactions, most similar to how our natural behaviour in the realworld, exampole are (looking around yourself, walking, running, picking, grabbing and throwing objects) - All these we can do in a VR world, Normal 3d games are limited to devices. The fact that these new actions mentioned above are possible in VR means there must be new ways to create them, and usually the efforts and coding skills required is too advanced for the majority of developers like you are me ….. And we have VR SDKs ; Simply a set of predefined scripts that aid us in developing. This approach should give you a much better idea of the whole concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-many-plugins-do-we-have&quot;&gt;How many Plugins do we have&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Unity, there are several SDKs for VR development, the reason being to accomodate support for various headserts and controller. As new brands release their own unique vr headsets, we see inevitably the introduction of their own personal SDK published to simply the development process for their own unique platform. Some SDKs support a wide range of headsets while others doesn’t. We are going to talk about this two variations and what SDKs exist fofr them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I can’t say accurately how many SDKs for the Un ity Platforms, probably because one is usua;lly released every now and then, but for sure, we have some popular ones common among majority of developers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open VR Unity Plugin: OpenVR is a software development kit (SDK)developed by Valve for supporting the SteamVR (HTC Vive) and other virtual reality headset (VR) devices.(Meaning that Using Open XR in Unity for VR Dev, all other headsets can access VR content created with it) The SteamVR platform uses it as the default application programming interface (API) and runtime. It handles display, tracking, and input for Open VR devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steam VR Unity Plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unity XR Interaction Toolkit: The Unity XR Interaction Toolkit is a Package Provided by Unity for creating VR, AR Experiences. It provides a framework that makes VR and UI interactions available from Unity input events(Keyboards, Gamepads, and Controllers, etc.). The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components and prefabs and an Interaction Manager that enables the relative working of these two components. It also contains helper components that you can use to extend functionality for drawing visuals and hooking in your interaction events. It can be used in both VR and AR Instances and comes with different functions, scripts, and classes for building gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unity XR Interaction Toolkit is a very new package released in the fall of 2019 to take the place of popular VR and AR Plugins like the HTC Vive Utility Plugin, Oculus VR Plugin, VRTK, etc. The goal is to provide a framework that allows simple integration of different VR SDKs, i.e (Building experiences that can be tailored to different standalone/ VR Headsets without hassles). Without diving into the details - The XR Interaction toolkit works to detect the device plugged in and switches functionality to it solely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among Plugins listed, the UIT is currently the easiest way to build VR Experiences, while not the most feasible as it’s still in preview release but holds unity support fully. For Developers completely new to VR dev and aiming for a fast progress, this package can be used to familarise with. It aslo supports integration of third party SDKs found on the unity assets store to build realistic experiences. To get started with this, read this guide &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Unity XR Toolkit - Important points to Note&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VRTK: VRTK is a collection of useful, reusable solutions to common problems found when building for virtual reality. VRTK aims to help productivity by speeding up the creation process from prototyping ideas to building complete solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VRTK Unity Plugin brings a whole lot of functionalities in a Drag-and-Drop System. It allows compatibility with a set of popular VR SDks like Oculus Plugin, Steam VR Plugin and even for Open VR.
The full list of Compatible Unity VR Plugins with VRTK and their Uses are listed below;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oculus VR SDK: For Targeting Oculus VR Headsets(Quest, Quest2)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Steam VR SDK: For Targeting Steam VR (SteamVR Platform on Steam)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DayDream VR SDK: For Targeting DayDream VR Headsets(Google Daydream)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windows MR SDK: For Targeting Windows Mixed Reality&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HyperReal VR SDK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simulator SDK: As a Mock HMD, VR without a Headset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ximmerse SDK&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wanna explore deeper using VRTK, ensure to follow this guide, take it from me - there are countless errors to run into &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;VRTK for Vr Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oculus Integration Plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;HTC Vive Unity Plugin:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open XR Unity Plugin: I left this for the least Plugin so as not to casue confusion among readers. Do you feel like we already mentioned this?. Go ahead and scroll up to identify the Difference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yhh!. The former is the Open ‘VR’ Plugin and this is the Open ‘XR’. So what’s the difference. Very Simple; The Open XR must be used with Unity’s new XR Plugin Managemnet. Confused?, Pls don’t be. let me shed some light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unity alas, has chosen to refer to VR content as XR, since they strongly believe their engine is more than capable for building AR experiences. So instead of lone VR, it’s now refereed to as XR. The Plugin Management is really just straight forward: The Plugoin Management. A way to manage the various plugins installed in a unity project. The image below shows how this management system looks. It basically checks and unchecks boxes to notify you of which XR Plugin installed is currently active. One of the main purpose of this system is to enhance “multi-platform development and publishing”, i.e When you are targeting several VR hardware for your content, you can install thier individual Sdks and manage it with the Plugin Manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now why leave this important infoprmation for the last part, because there’s a whole new world for you to uncover?, Or just Read? 😶. That’s where the Open XR comes in, practically invades.
&lt;b&gt;The Open XR Plugin&lt;/b&gt; is one of those sdks that can be used with the XR Plugin Management and what is it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s shares similarities with the Open VR Plugin in that it can be used for multi-platform development. It supports head tracking, display but… it ends there. Yhh, this is a relatively new plugin, still in preview mode and no suitable interaction/input system method(grabbing, throwing, teleportation) is currently supported. It can be used by itself, or integrated with steam vr for full input support. Still, you can choose for hooking up input systems between the input Steam VR Plugin or Unity XR Interaction toolkit. Only one can be used at a time, both aren’t compatible. A detailed guide is coming soon on how to set this up on unity, but if you want to test the waters urself, you can follow this link to downlaod the preview version &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Open XR Unity SDK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;xr-plugin-managemnet-compatible-sdks&quot;&gt;XR Plugin Managemnet Compatible SDKs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After briefing on the XR Managemnet and how Open XR is compatible with it, I want to pass across and important point to note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using the XR Plugin Management, You CANT use Standalone SDKs like (Steam VR, Oculus VR, Open VR etc). And likewise, by using any of the standalone SDKs you can make use of the XR Plugin Managemnet Tool in your Project. You either use one. Open XR as we have seen is a compatible plugin, what other sdks exist that are compatible, below they are listed with a singular way of installing them;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oculus XR Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Windowsmr XR Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mock HMD XR Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Oculus Android Plugin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The common way to install them among your project’s package is Goto Windows &amp;gt; Package Manager &amp;gt; Search for Individual Names &amp;gt; Click Install in the bottom rigth corner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this detailed summary of the various VR SDKs/ XR SDKs, can you Identify those requiring usage for a special hardware and those that can be used for multiple platform development. If you can’t, I’ve totally failed as a developer and writer 🤔. Ah, let’s leave that for later, we shall see&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;which-of-them&quot;&gt;Which of Them?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You read enough, infact you deserve a congratulatory message, drop your email and that would be attended to. I mean, you’ve read enough of them theory, your teeth must be craving for just some practice. Lucky, I made necessary plans for that. Among the various SDKs Listed, you probably have a favourite already, but is that the most suited for you. Read On, In this section, we talk about choosing a SDK to start Development with in consideration of some Factors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The easiest SDK: UIT

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-unity-interaction-toolkit&quot;&gt;About the Unity Interaction Toolkit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Unity XR Interaction Toolkit is a Package Provided by Unity for creating VR, AR Experiences.

The core of this system is a set of base Interactor and Interactable components and prefabs and an Interaction Manager that enables the relative working of these two components.

Without diving into the details - The XR Interaction toolkit works to detect the device plugged in and switches functionality to it solely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One thing to Note&lt;/b&gt; but which isn’t the focus of this tutorial is that the XR Interaction Toolkit is part of the XR Plugin Management which in whole refers to all Plugins and SDKs that can be mapped and integrated with the XR Interaction Toolkit for VR Development. Later in this tutorial, We are gonna look at some of them like the Oculus XR Plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can go on with more explanation but, a much better way for you to grasp the whole concept involved is through visualization and hands-on testing. For this reason, In the next section, we look at how to install and open in Unity a Starter template that uses the XR Interaction Toolkit for VR development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;installation-of-unitys-xr-interaction-toolkit-starter-template&quot;&gt;Installation of Unity’s XR Interaction Toolkit Starter Template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are gonna install the Starter Template which we are later going to open in Unity before we can start understanding each component in detail, to begin, follow the steps below or even the Guide video;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Download the XR Interaction Toolkit Starter Template from this Repo Link &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples&quot;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Extract the Folder Using Windows File Explorer or any other third party software&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After extraction - Copy the VR folder inside the Xr interaction toolkit file out to another location and Rename it e.g Downloads&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open up Unity Hub and Click the Add Projects Button - When Prompted select the recent VR project folder you extracted&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You would need to select a particular unity version for opening this project - Anything from LTS 2019.4 - 2020 versions should work fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When Unity opens fully, Go to Scenes folder in the Projects tab and open the “World Interaction Scene”
If you follow the listed steps correctly, in the scene view you should see something like below. If that isn’t the case for you, please leave a comment below and I will be glad to help. Some of the common problems that arise are (pink screen, error in the console, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../assets/images/Blog/Blog-img/UIT_Opened.png&quot; class=&quot;img-fluid responsive&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you have it opened up, we can move on to the more juicy part of this article 😉; Explaining what is happening on the screen and how to set up for a VR project. Let’s quickly get down to it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;features-of-uit-from-now-on-uit-means-unity-xr-interaction-toolkit&quot;&gt;Features of UIT (From now on UIT means Unity XR Interaction Toolkit)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By features, what do I mean? I mean this; What can you as a developer achieve with UIT. In this section, I hope to give you a general to specifics scoped idea without anything much as Jargon!.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Playing around with a few VR SDKs before my recent relationship with Unity’s UIT, I had one goal in mind - Build a prototype VR Project. Back then, I used VRTK to test the waters and now I use UIT rather comfortably for someone without previous experience with P_lugins and SDKs integration. My honest opinion is that I love UIT and wish more features can be added to it because it makes building so much easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fair to say that UIT hasn’t reached the level of functionalities VRTK and other SDKs bring to the table but there’s one important value VR Developers need called _____ which it has great promise for. Less talk now, let’s meet the features of my new best friend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interactors &amp;amp; Interactables: This Point doesn’t need much explanation. It’s well known that every VR World/experience must have basic interactors(In layman terms - XR Controllers) and Interactables (Objects you can Grab and Select). As for AR, this isn’t a requirement because the physics associated with it often involves overlaying objects on surfaces without much need for interaction, which is not to say that in some cases interaction isn’t used.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Interactors - UIT achieves this Feature using the &lt;b&gt;Cross-platform XR controller input&lt;/b&gt; Component. There are three main functions this provides (Object hover, select, and grab)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Interactables - For an object to be an active Interactable, it must have a collection of scripts applied to it - the main being the XR Grab Interactable, XR Direct Interactable, XR Simple Interactable. These three are used differently and of the three, the first is most frequently used.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A VR Camera Rig: As Expected, when creating VR Experiences, the differentiating factor is a 360-degree world that can be viewed from different angles, as such, what makes this possible is a VR Camera Rig. UIT comes with an XR rig that can be configured for either room or stationary VR. There isn’t much talk about this after it has been added to the scene, one important detail to know is that the XR controllers are usually children of this Prefab in the Hierarchy.
NOTE: Once the Sample UIT Package is Successfully set up - You have access to Most components directly from the GameObject Window.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Teleportation: With UIT, you can set up teleportation using the XR Controller. It Involves a fairly easy process of creating an area/plane and adding the Teloprataion Component to it. This allows the Player to hover over active fields and appear there instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Visual Feedback/ Line rendering: perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of VR. Grabbing objects far away from the player and teleportation. The Line Renderer or Raycaster projects a Line (Color remains Unfixed) from your virtual controllers when you hover around Active fields - What I mean by this, Are you hovering over an Interactable or an area with teleportation set to active? If so, this Indicating Line is projected. By default, the Line Renderer is enabled to constantly project regardless if the state is set to active but this can be fixed with a little code.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Haptic Feedback: Since Haptics isn’t a new term in the VR field, I would avoid divulging deeply into this. Customary, UIT has this feature that can be set up with the XR Controllers for giving a Haptics signals when Certain Events are Triggered in VR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly, there are always more features that I decide to not mention here, the above more-important ones are the core of UIT that must be understood while others can be picked up along the way. Dash it all! I have built a working VR Prototype Project with just the core features explained above 🥱. Oh, I promise, More good stuff to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;oculus-xr-plugin-for-uit&quot;&gt;Oculus XR Plugin for UIT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Statista, &lt;a href=&quot;statista.com/vr&quot;&gt;50% Of VR Developers create VR Games to Publish on the Oculus Store&lt;/a&gt;. If this doesn’t ring a bell, Well, Nothing might for you. Because Oculus is the fastest-growing Platform both for Developers and Gamers. - For Devs, Revenue - For Gamers, Premium Entertainment (Absolutely Relative). As such, developers at Oculus were quick to get news about Unity’s revised plan and created a plugin just for folks adopting the UIT package for VR Development. Today, You are gonna learn about this High-Budget Plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to create games for Oculus Standalone Headsets or Oculus Go and also plan to use the UIT package, one thing is constant - You need the Oculus XR Plugin. Much of what I talked about above applies to it as well, so you probably do get the hang of what it goes. So now, let’s go right into how to install and configure it for the current starter scene in Unity (if you have it open, and not having ignored me this whole time). Follow the Ordered steps below, I won’t write it twice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With Unity Opened with the Starter Template on Scene view, you have almost all requirement ready save one&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to Windows &amp;gt; Package Manager. In PM search for Oculus XR Plugin, Install and wait for it to Import&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now go to Edit &amp;gt; Project Settings &amp;gt; XR Plugin Management. inside this section, Check the box - Initialize XR on Startup and Oculus.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Further to this, by following this process you are enabling to build on a PC, MAC, or Linus machine. For Android build, switch the tab and enable Oculus there.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! After you complete these steps, you can now “hopefully” run the Game view and experience the scene in VR. Indeed very easy, just my thought too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea here is this, you can play or create any small scene with a few objects directly in Unity, Using the XR Interaction toolkit, by ensuring that a few certain prefabs are present in the Scene! What are they? Where can you find them in?. As we move into the next section we are gonna tackle these questions, that way I kill two birds with a stone. 😎&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You now know how to set up UIT with your Oculus Headset but there’s one more detail I need to observe - What if you have no Headsets and you just love VR?. I was once in that same position and I can tell you that it’s not as impossible as everyone says it is - Developing without a Headset. Unity in part has made this possible with the &lt;b&gt;Mock HMD XR Plugin&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;unity-mock-hmd-xr-plugin&quot;&gt;Unity Mock HMD XR Plugin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In simple terms, the above reference means this - An Head Mounted Display that isn’t a real version but mimics how the real version operates. Similar to the Oculus XR Plugin we looked at above, the Mock HMD Display allows you to move and interact in a virtual world without the need for a headset. It collects input actions from the plain old Keyboard, Gamepads, and other input devices. The Mock HMD functions in a similar way to how you’d expect the Oculus XR Plugin to; Basic interactions are mapped similarly with little changes in the input method. To set up a Mock HMD in your Project, follow the same steps that apply for the OCP by of course searching and installing from the package manager; Mock HMD XR. When Installed, don’t expect it to work from the onset because there is a little more process involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to be stuck to the starter template without building from scratch. Like I mentioned earlier, some particular prefabs need hooking up together for UIT to be fully integrated into a project, take note of them because they are listed below. Access them by simply searching in the projects tab search;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XR Rig Demo [Prefab] - Necessary for your scene to be translated into VR 360 degree. It also houses the XR Virtual Controllers and other components that it requires e.g Ray Caster, Line Renderer, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Input Action Manager [Prefab] - To manage Input Actions from the Keyboard, XR Controller, Gamepad. Etc. This way you can write functions such as - OnButtonDownPressed&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Interaction Manager [Script] - Create an Empty game object and Add the Interaction Manager Script to it. This is for well, managing interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XR Base Interactor [Script] - Should be added to any game object that you want to be interactable (grab, select, hover)
To get On Button Pressed Event, I might have to use or call the XR Device Simulator function.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For Use without a Headset, Install the &lt;b&gt;XR Device Simulator&lt;/b&gt; from the package manager and add it to the Hierarchy. Some values, keypress mappings need to still be set up before use, watch the video below as this is complicated in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the list goes On as complexity increases. Now that you have a good solid understanding of the UIT package, focus for 5 minutes on the scene reading prefabs names and viewing their properties in the Hierarchy. It has been a very long Guide and as much as I have tried to make it all well if for instance you prefer or need further assistance through video, Splendid!, I have a video on just this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

In this tutorial, I’m gonna work you through a technique that makes it possible to build VR content and test them without the need for a headset. The aim of this article is to introduc vrtk plugin through simple explanatiuons and to detail the steps required to set it up on your own development machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, Let’s take a better look briefly at what VRTK is and how it aims to simplify building VR functionalities along also enabling Developers without a Proper VR Kit have a chance at Building for VR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-vrtk&quot;&gt;What is VRTK&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VRTK is a collection of useful, reusable solutions to common problems found when building for virtual reality. VRTK aims to help productivity by speeding up the creation process from prototyping ideas to building complete solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From this definition, we can see that this helpul tool can be applied for other use-cases and not just for testing during development process, later in this article, we would breifly cover the main use-cases so you can understand better - what can and can’t be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-can-it-be-used&quot;&gt;How can it be Used?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VRTK Unity Plugin brings a whole lot of functionalities in a Drag-and-Drop System. It allows compatibility with a set of popular VR SDks like Oculus Plugin, Steam VR Plugin and even for Open VR. The full list of Compatible Unity VR Plugins with VRTK and their Uses are listed below;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Oculus XR Plugin -&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Steam VR Plugin -&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open VR -&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Install and set up VRTK as a Unity Project&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Download the zip file of the Unity project that contains the VRTK plugin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ExtendRealityLtd/VRTK/archive/master.zip&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Extract the file to an easily accessible folder on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open up Unity Hub and select Add, then locate the extracted VRTK folder and finally open it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before you can use the tool feature, you have to edit the project settings by setting it up for VR; to do that &lt;b&gt;Go to Edit, Project settings, Player, Under XR Settings - Check VR reality supported&lt;/b&gt; and Under Other settings &lt;b&gt;Make sure that API Compatibility Level is set to .NET 4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the Projects tab, open the folders in this order, Assets,Samples,Farm,Scene - In the Scene folder, Click ExampleScene and open it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the the Game view press play. After about 10 seconds, you can see a farmlike environments and experience it in 360. This process can make development work very easy for you even without a headset. Although, you would need to take a few minutes to learn how the control works, but once u’ve mastered it, this tool can be very effective for testing your virtual reality prototypes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at some other features of VRTK that males it such an important VR Dev tool for every developer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are frustrated from buying games only to be left unsatisfied because of poor graphics or unexciting story line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You’re are not alone&lt;/b&gt;. In truth, That’s been the pain of majority of Gamers. It takes time, a lot of it, to search for quality games that are worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of reviews for newly released games by blogs and channels, the thruth is that most of them gets a commission for their time. So, you feel like you are always misled continually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, I wanna stick to the facts in this blog posts. Most of my research are on platforms like Steam, Reddit channels and official websites of these VR developers. Youtube is excluded from my list and that’s because majority of false information concerning Vr games can be found on youtube Channels. That said, &lt;b&gt;Note&lt;/b&gt; that I embed gameplay videos from youtube. This is done only after I have verified the game quality from the other sources mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list comprises newly released Vr titles and those that have not gained enormous popularity yet. I chose to excluded the best VR games like Half-life, Beat Saber etc, because chances are you have heard of these titles, played them, or are yet to. That said, let jump right into the top Vr Games with Hand-Tracking enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10+ Best Hand-Tracking Vr Games On Oculus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5 style=&quot;font-weight: 600;&quot;&gt;Phasmophobia&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/arKjeSLA3n0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a phychological ghost multiplayer Vr game unlike any ghost vr game you have played till now. It has great graphics which are very realistic. 
&lt;br /&gt;
In this game, you can play with your freinds, how fun is that?. The goal is to hunt down ghosts with fancy gadgets and provide evidence of paranomical existence

It is a still a new game with first release on September 24 but it has a huge community and fan-base which are mostly positive in reviews.

The Game supports all the major VR headsets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt; (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Valve Index)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h5 style=&quot;font-weight: 600;&quot;&gt;The Room VR: A Dark Matter&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iySB6jnYwYE&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game falls in-between mystery and explorer. One outstanding feature is it's graphics. Explore cryptic locations that have been designed with such realism. It also comes with a very good story: You are a detective sent out by The British Institute of Archaeology to investigate the sudden disappearance of an esteemed Egyptologist. 
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in investigation and puzzle experiences like me, then you would love this game.
&lt;br /&gt;
Another aspect of the game worth mentioning is the smaller fan-base it has. This can be said to be the result of the &quot;genre&quot; of this adventure which I assume most people aren't interested in. But if you are, then you must buy this game. It's wonderful
&lt;br /&gt;
One review from Edge magazinge completes my thought about this game:
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;The Room has never been short of atmosphere, but in VR it’s more enveloping than ever. The quality of the craftsmanship is hard to deny, and what follows is as thrilling a VR experience we’ve had outside City 17, with a finale that blends Lovecraft and Spielberg.”
8/10 – EDGE Magazine&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The Game supports all the major VR headsets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is kind of an action game(because you fight in it. But not exactly full-time action). It also has some fantasy atmosphere in it. It's a local multiplayer game(you can only play with friends close by). You can play as Giant Overseer or Tiny Challenger and whatever role you pick, you get to win if you defeat you opponent by tracking them down or excaping through the crowds in both cases. 
&lt;br /&gt;
It graphics lays around being mysterious,unsettling  and scenic rather than robustness like can be found in Half-Life. If you love Vr games with stelth and intensity then you should absolutely check this out, Like NOW!.
&lt;br /&gt;
I haven't personally tried it out, yet. But from the reviews of a game just out on October 8, something fantastic must be going on it.

&lt;h5 style=&quot;font-weight: 600;&quot;&gt;Karnage Chronicles&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/POAGlE7P5HM&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karnage Chronicals is a mystical RPG Action Vr game. I have to give it to them for the graphis, they are legit realistic. You can feel the kind of atmosphere portrayed by just watching a preview of it. So in Karnage, the story is that a the world is ruled by magic and you are tasked with finding a cosmic force and cryptic. It's clearly a magical adventure but the game doesn't let in on that on the title page.
&lt;br /&gt;
After watching the preview, the game is awesome. It has humor and funny characters, i think a tiny goblin?
&lt;br /&gt;
As such, it has a good community following and positive reviews. It's not a game I would play, I'm not really into action in ancient worlds. If all the elements and features of karnage can be replicated in an action game but with guns, that's my ideal type.
&lt;br /&gt;
After watching the preview, what do you think? would you be playing karnage soon? can't make a decision? Let me help; If you like magic, ugly creatures and quests that involves splashing around the gore of creatures! Hmm? Ok, I think you get the point now
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game is an adventure in the Britannic, sister of the in famous Titanic ship and how it sunk after striking a mine during the First World War. 
&lt;br /&gt;
So in case you didn't figure yet, it more like an educational and learning experience, but that's not all. It has detailed information about the Britannic, it's architecture and contributions to the World War.
&lt;br /&gt;
Although, it's just an education vr adventure, I was surprised by the amount of Positive ratings which tells that this game has a lot more to offer than just what we see in the preview.
&lt;br /&gt;
The Game supports all the major VR headsets exempting Windows Mixed Reality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This Vr game is action-packed with breathtaking action film, full of explosions and dynamic tactics.
Wardust is a massive multiplayer VR game where upto 64 players can feature in a match.

&lt;i&gt;&quot;With 64 fighters on the battlefield, War Dust will take you into the largest online battles that have ever been made in VR. Everyone has a role to play on the battlefield: one single man, at the right place at the right time, can make a decisive difference. Get ready to be this difference, to dare, to fight, and defeat your enemies.&quot; ---War Dust Steam&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the graphics are not robust, don't let that full you. In reality, the battleground for war is never an amazing sight.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a medieval vr fantasy game set around the world of battle between towns. The special thing about this game is it's ability to engage in melee attacks with realistic physics.
&lt;br /&gt;
One more reason I love this game, is that altghough it's a battle ship game, you can experience other environments like the bar and club.
&lt;br /&gt;
In your missions, you don;t just fight, you can ride an horse, run, shoot an arrow, in fact almost everything that a real-life battle brings with it.
&lt;br /&gt;
Already Interested? You should. If you're looking for an exciting and adventurous Vr title with many activities, this game has it all - plus it is packed with 30 hours of game time exploring medieval worlds and protecting your lands. Shoot!

Still having some doubt- read this review by UploadVR
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;“Mount &amp;amp; Blade is an extremely popular and successful series of medieval simulation games in which you raise an army, conquer kingdoms, and engage in epic, intense battles with dozens of troops around you. From sieges to horseback rampages, it’s got it all. Tales of Glory is basically that, but in VR.”

&lt;p&gt;You are one of many who set off in search of a better life in the distant bastion of scientific progress. Your goal is a colony planet, free from bureaucratic, religious and other radical restrictions.
&lt;br /&gt;
Here they research and freely use industrial teleportation, transfer of consciousness and other technologies prohibited in the inhabited worlds. Factories, power plants, mines and residential complexes of the planet are fully automated. All the dirty and hard work is done by robotic shells controlled by the operator’s mind. It is a high-tech paradise. But here, something went wrong.
&lt;br /&gt;
As soon as you wake up from a long sleep in a capsule of hibernation, you fall into circulation. Radical fanatics are here too. A virus was launched into information networks that turned robots into aggressive death machines. The paradise planet plunged into the chaos of war. The inhabitants of the colony took the seats of the operators of robotic shells and sent their army of robots into battle. Joint efforts have borne fruit.

I know you do. Here’s one thing, starting off on the wrong foot can make it very tough for you to attain that level in the expected amount of time before you lose the passion you once had. Here’s why:
&lt;!-- Statistics --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the process of gathering any new skill there are two very important things you should keep in mind: Decision &amp;amp; Action.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can’t make prompt decision, the action side of things diminishes significantly. And that’s not very good because actions makes you achieve goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I will cover and explain all the necessary areas you should know before getting in vr development for whatever purpose you might have(video games, education, movies, medicine, automobiles).Please Note that, more attention is focused on video games development in vr. Let’s begin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps guiding us through this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gentle Introduction to VR Development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 Essentials for VR Dev (Main Content)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;10 Great tools for VR Development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is virtual reality development&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers, storytellers, artists, beginners, etc. all have an opportunity to build immersive experiences using an exciting new technology that literally pushes the bounds of content creation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VR content development is similar to 3D game development in that it the spatial design of a large, immersive 3D worlds that the player/user will traverse on her own. But in truth, it is not similar to 3D game development, there is a wide range of differences between the two like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Immersion: The users are placed in a virtual space, cut from the real world on a sensory level. VR headsets allow this by occupying their whole field of vision, while headphones achieve the same results with sounds, thus fully immersing the users in another world.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Positioning: How is the world positioned relative to the user(player)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double Lens: The worlds must be viewed from a double lens headset, how to provision for this&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interaction: To feel real, a simulated environment should include virtual elements we can interact with: picking up an item, swinging a sword to kill a goblin, breaking a mug, pushing the ignition button of plane in a flight simulator, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sensory feedback/Tracking: Vr headsets track the position of the users within a given space so that the computer renders the changes of positions. Users moving their heads or bodies will be given the illusion that they are moving in the virtual world.
In short, a vr world has to meet a few or all the features above for it to be considered immersive.
Keeping that in mind, let’s look at how &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; can kickstart career in Virtual reality for whatever your purpose might be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10 Essentials to know before starting VR Development&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Begin your Technical training&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;So you want to start creating VR worlds and certainly you have some ideas on where to start or you don’t have at all. Thankfully, there is a small circle of resources available for you to choose from so here it’s easier to make a decision. The two main softwares/game engines we have that can accomplish your goals are unity and unreal engine. As a beginner it is recommended to start with unity for these benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unity has a very simple learning curve. You can start making simple games and intercations in a little as a week if you put in enough time, believe me.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unity is free for all to use until you start earning a large sum of money which by then you would have no problems in showing appreciation by paying up.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unity has wide and growing support for other purpose aside from video games like movie production, 3D animation, education, medicine and space. As you can see, there is something for everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;There is &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of resources you can use to learn and improve your vr development skill. Unity is dedicated to helping beginners be successful in thier chosen course.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I expect that you have a decision to make unity your development home because it would favour you greatly. About the resources i mentioned, these would help you get started:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development&quot;&gt;Unity Learn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/virtual-reality/getting-started-vr-development&quot;&gt;Unity Youtube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/solutions/automotive-transportation-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Film, animation and cinematics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/solutions/automotive-transportation-manufacturing&quot;&gt;Automotive, Transportation &amp;amp; Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/solutions/architecture-engineering-construction&quot;&gt;Architecture, Engineering &amp;amp; Construction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unity.com/solutions/edtech&quot;&gt;Build quality learning apps, games and simulations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Using this resources, you can start to work with unity to realize your dream of building VR world in any industry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;choose-your-focus-technical-or-graphical&quot;&gt;Choose your Focus: Technical or Graphical&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Just like in 3D game development, VR general purpose development also demands skillful focus on two main areas: Technical(Building the environment and making it interactive with codes) and Graphical(designing the environment with artistic software,assets). This tells you that it is not recommended to be the programmer and the graphics designer at the same time: It just wont work for you. I used to think that if I put in a lot time, I could achieve everything alone but in truth, for you to become a pro in VR development you would have to put in so much time and efforts which is not guaranteed if you are doing two things at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Now let’s say you decide to focus your resources in coding , you might be asking how you can acquire assets to use for building your environment and scenes. Why this mnight have been a big concern a few years back for indie createors, it isn’t anymore there are lots of ways you can get graphics to complete your projects. Follow the steps below where I would guide you through the process:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h4 id=&quot;for-technical-and-programming-focused&quot;&gt;For Technical and Programming focused&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As someone focused on developing vr applications on unity engine alone, you want a simple way to get the assets/models of your choice to use in prototype and production level versions. I have compiled a list of the best places to get models, most are free others cost a few dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://assetstore.unity.com/&quot;&gt;Unity Asset Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sketchfab.com/&quot;&gt;Sketchfab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://poly.google.com/&quot;&gt;Google Poly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cgtrader.com/&quot;&gt;CGTrader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.turbosquid.com/&quot;&gt;Turbosquid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;h4 id=&quot;for-graphical-and-design-focused&quot;&gt;For Graphical and Design focused&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are graphics inclined and want to develop for vr, focusing on your skills would bring great benefits in time. The market for virtual reality desginers is expected to grow by 10% by 2025 according to statista. This is because 60^ of people involved in  3d games and VR development are software devs and programmers. But, as you may have thought you also require the skills of a programmer in whatever projects you might take up, I sourced around for the best way to go about this:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Consider searching on some freelance websites dedicated for VR Development&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Get involved in the Unity/VR Reddit groups. many people have found partners and went on to complete projects together. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/&quot;&gt;Reddit Unity3D&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/&quot;&gt;Reddit virtualreality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the first case though, you would need to spend some cash for hiring a developer you can team up with. I recommend selling your graphics skills either on some frelance websites you can find or generally any of the listed 3D models store above.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;determine-your-target-platform&quot;&gt;Determine your Target Platform&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This means that you should identify the platform or device your VR applications would work on. Is it a specific OS like Android, IOS, Windows or General like mobile devices against PC. Also, ofc we have the newer Standalone devices like Oculus Quest, Go, Rift and HTC Vive which runs on AndroidOS and Steam VR respectively. As a beginner, it is necessary that your applications has support for mobile devices because it’s easier to market it to consumers. Also as a business/company creating VR experiences to market a new product to your customers, it’s more realistic to develop for mobile devices has greater audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;test-your-work-with-the-right-hardware&quot;&gt;Test your work with the right hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Every VR Developer needs to have a test unit to see how the application works and what bugs need to be fixed while still in development mode. Depending on the kind of app your are building, your VR gear and system would vary.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you want to target casual users of VR, develop for Google Daydream or GearVR, you would need to have a similar VR Headset for your dev process This would ensure that you have a working prototype similar to how you want your users to interact with your app with no flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;And if you want to target premium VR users, develop for Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, you would need to make the adjustments for that.
Once you’ve determined your target platform and associated hardware/headset, consider any computing requirements. For Rift and Vive, you’ll likely need to invest in a PC gaming computer that contains a solid graphics card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;h3 id=&quot;consider-the-system-reqirements&quot;&gt;Consider the System Reqirements&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before installing your preferred software in this case Unity Engine, be sure that your computer meets the necessary system requirements for development process. This would help you before-hand evaluate your system specifications and make any necessary adjustments before you begin.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Below is the required system specs for unity VR Development:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4 id=&quot;windows&quot;&gt;Windows&lt;/h4&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;OS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.12+&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;GPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Processor: 1.1 GHz Processor&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Memory: 4 GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Storage: Upto 10GB Free Space allocated for Unity Dev&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these you know know what’s in store and can make tweak your system if it does not already meet the required specs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there you have it, 5 things to consider before starting VR development. This can take you just a day to figure out or in some cases, weeks. It all depends on how prepared you have been till now i.e learning the ropes. That said, I think some tools will be greatly helpful for you in your vr journey whatever your propose might be. Take a look at them below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;top-5-vr-software-development-tools&quot;&gt;Top 5 VR Software Development tools&lt;/h3&gt;

To be honest it can leave you significantly unsatisfied with the choices you make . That’s what the ongoing excitement around VR is meant to create among gamers and developers. Should it be this way? - Probably Yes, if at all a thing is exciting enough people should be ready to chop their heads off for it (virtually so). Is this healthy for you , Mentally and Financially so - Certainly not XD. What were you expecting me to say. My aim for this article is to provide a comprehensive guide that would direct your thoughts into making the best choice for your “Cause”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the steps guiding us through this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do you need an Oculus Rift S?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The essentials to consider before making a choice&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to go about making a satisfying VR headset choice for your CAUSE.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly you might have had conflicting opinions and felt unsatisfaction with choices you may have made concerning VR products till now, but that’s only normal. As humans, when we are excited about a new trend, we tend to feel every choice we made was the wrong one, we are always looking for the perfect one. In truth, this has been the same with every trend-setting product released till date - Iphone X, Windows Updates, Branded Clothes etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Do you need an Oculus Rift S&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you need an Oculus Rift S vr headset now? - Chances are you don’t need one. As is the case, gamers feels like they surely do, but this in truth is not always necessary or essential to their needs. I consider myself a gamer, not just that - I’m passionate about experiencing VR gaming. But I can’t see myself buying an Oculus Rift S with mine or my parent’s money for some important reasons, to find out if you need an oculus rift s, consider these questions below and answer them according to your own situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How many hours do you spend on VR gaming every week? Less than 10 hours and you probably do not&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can you afford the cost of an Oculus Rift S with you own personal income?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you hope to achieve with an Oculus Rift: Intense game competition, Youtube Let’s play videos, VR- game Development
Let’s consider the following:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For Intense Gaming and Youtube Let’s play videos, it’s possible in every respect to opt for a more affordable headset that would work just as well as gaming on an Oculus headset.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For vr development, it’s not advised to limit your testing headset to an Oculus or better still, as a beginner, Oculus supported games are NOT the best starting point for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conclusion - No matter what use case you want a VR headset for if your budget does not adequately allow for it, an Oculus Rift S is not the best option to consider as other more affordable brands can achieve your goals for you without hassels. That being said, there still exist a lot of options to consider which can prove confusing andd intangible for a noob to comtemplate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next few sections, I would give you a working cheat sheet to help you contemplate and secure the best decision for your personal unique situatiuon. Read on!!
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Features/Essentials of a VR headset&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start, I want to assure you that while surface-discussing the features of a VR headset, I choose to leave the technical details alone on Wikipedia because I assume you fall into the category of Gamer/VR Dev and sincerely just want a straight-forward honest discussion on these terms. Now let’s begin&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some essential key point features of VR headset that Brands look to include in their products are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quality: The quality of a VR headset refers to it’s rendering power. i.e how fast it is able to play 3D graphics every second. In computing language this is called fps or frames per seconds. One small detail to note: because a vr headset has two viewing angle(providing separate images for each eye), it has to render 2X the graphics of a game whereas a regular PC or gaming device renders just once. As a result, this leads to low quality in some experiences or frame-skipping. Vr headsets also come with gyroscopes, accelerometer and magnetometers, the power of these head-tracking sensors dirctly determines the quality of the headset. Now you know some of the details, it’s necessary to check the capacity of a headset so you know what to expect before-hand. Today as technology keeps advancing, VR headsets comapnies are finding it less difficult to equip their product with working quality systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Control: Some VR Headset comes with controllers equipped, this is a device that enables hand-tracking so the player’s movement can be simulated in the Vr world. Most games today require a player’s movement for interaction within the game, so this is a very important feature. An addition to controllers &lt;i&gt;Haptic feedback&lt;/i&gt; is the sense of touch designed to provide information to the end user, is already built into a number of existing virtual reality controllers&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Comfort: Most VR Brands live up comfortably to this particular feature, but certainly when considering low priced headsets you have to consider the comfortability it comes with. In short,&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Does the headset feel comfortable to wear for long use&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Can the strap - if it comes with one, be adjusted or removed for cleaning&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Does it feel itchy or heavy to put on
These are some questions to consider when checking the comfort that comes with a VR headset.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How to go about making a satisfying VR headset choice for your CAUSE.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would highlight some necessary steps you can take to choose the best vr headset for you current situation and needs.
There are essentially, three categories of VR headset when grouped based on price:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;low-priced headsets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;medium-priced headsets&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;high-cost headsets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all cases and situations, people use products &amp;amp; items differently. Some use it more, other less. Defining what your proirities are in using a vr headset would already tell you which group you belong to.
To make the selection process easier for you, I would highlight some popular use cases of a vr headset today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Popular Use-Cases of a VR headset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gaming: By far, the most popular use case of a vr headset is for playing Vr games. You have to ask yourself two very important question: How much time do you spend on gaming?, Do you spend money to purchase high-quality vr games?. After arriving at the answers to these questions, make a decision on what kind of vr headset you need:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Usually if you spend less than 5 hrs a week playing vr games &amp;amp; you don't spend money buying vr games, I recommend going for a medium-priced headsets. Below I will give you a variety of options to choose from&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, go for a highpriced headset if you spend substancial time and money on vr games, if you use a headset professionally like a for youtube channel &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;VR Development: With that mentioned, a group of people dedicated to developing for vr exists and if you fall under that group, I have got you covered. Likewise, two main sub-groups exixst:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do you develop vr games for sale are you an intermediate vr developer, if so a medium quality headset should work fine for testing prototype and scenes according to the quality of your games.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Are you a beginner or hobbyist to vr games development. You might be an indie game dev but are not yet making money from your games. If you fall into anyone of these, a low-priced headset would do the job for you and also saved you irrelevant expenses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that’s sorted, by now you should have a decision in mind based on which cases are similar to your needs. Below you can review the headsets of your choice before making a purchase decision and start living your dream of owning a virtual reality headset for whatever purpose; gaming, entertainment, development etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Chel</name></author><summary type="html">VR is the new drill for gamers, with it comes much hassel about what is the trend and how to keep up with it.

If that statement reads true, why do the gaming community debate tirelesssly over the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive HMDs. Starting today this shouldn’t be the case for you, there are dozens of VR headsets looking to offer you great quality and experience without first cashing out on you. Wanna find out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Main targets of this article&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What should you get from a VR headset&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Quality Headsets to Buy that are not Oculus, HTC, Valve Index or PSVR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s much ongoing debate in the gaming community about which VR headset is the best among others. There are thousands of reviews by people looking to change your opinion on which headset to buy, although they do this with a good cause in mind. In reality, this only strenthens the arguments people have and causes much confusion for people like you, and earlier on - me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should not at all be the case. Most importantly, you should not alllow yourself to be dragged into this rave because it’s expected to continue on for a long time as Facebook(Oculus) and (HTC Vive) release new versions of their headset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Virtual reality headsets are only as good as the experiences they offer”. I got this statement from PCMag, a reputable website that writes on VR. Certainly, that statement reads true, so why do we all bother with all the arguments and indecisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve played a few VR games till now, geared with the HTC Vive, one thing stands true - if the quality of the game isn’t fantastic, you get the same quality regardless of what headset you have on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say all this without even considering the enormous price tag on them. It’s just pointless considering you can derive the same satisfaction regardless of the headset you use, In fact “quality largely depends on the game”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Who is this Article mainly for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is for three categories of people:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are yet to buy a headset, confused between Oculus, HTC, Valve Index since that seems to be what everyone talks about but “you want something cheaper that fits your budget”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You have sufficient budget to purcahse a top-priced headset but just like me you are conservative and would consider all options where you can get a decent quality headset that works just like Oculus etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You are an avid gamer, you want something similar to Oculus &amp;amp; co, you are stubborn to not bring your expectation down a bit, also you don’t want to spend so much on a vr headset. Trust me on this one, this post is also for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I introduce some fantastic affordable headsets to you and also to prove the validity and relevance of this article, I want to go through the main components of a VR headset thatmuch people weigh before making a decision to buy or not to. The point of this is to streamline/filter my list to products that meet the required components to a very decent level. I do not hope to delve into the technicalities of these properties, I’m just gonna be using a language gamers understand best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Features of a VR Headset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Quality: The quality of a VR headset refers to it’s rendering power. i.e how fast it is able to play 3D graphics every second. In computing language this is called fps or frames per seconds. One small detail to note: because a vr headset has two viewing angle(providing separate images for each eye), it has to render 2X the graphics of a game whereas a regular PC or gaming device renders just once.

Now you know some of the details, it’s necessary to check the capacity of a headset so you know what to expect before-hand. Today as technology keeps advancing, VR headsets comapnies are finding it less difficult to equip their product with working quality systems.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These two are the basic features of a vr headset, some headsets don’t come with all the sensors and systems mentioned but I make it my business to bring you the best headsets that are affordable and effecient.
We come now to the main content of this post:&lt;/p&gt;
