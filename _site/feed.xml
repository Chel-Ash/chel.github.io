❏Characters❏&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Mai&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mai is the first angel you encounter. She’s cute and well-meaning but has a lot to learn when it comes to normal human behavior. This can lead to some “interesting” situations. She cares deeply for her sister Meg, an angel banished to earth. She’ll stop at nothing to bring her home, but is that Meg really wants?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Reina&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reina comes to earth to help Mai find Meg. Apparently Mai said it was okay for Reina to stay at your house. Well, at least, she is more familiar with human customs. Reina is an intelligent peacemaker with a playful side. Not only can she diffuse any situation with her words, but she can also use her AESP (Angelic Extrasensory Perception) to turn things in her favor. Will her powers be enough to take on the devils in the school?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Meg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Meg is Mai’s sister. She’s stubborn but kindhearted. Desiring to help humanity, she was banished from the angelic realm by the Archangel for meddling in earthly affairs. Meg has grown accustomed to life on earth, having grown bored of the strict lifestyle back home anyway. She doesn’t seem thrilled to hear that Mai wants to take her back to Heaven. But will the Archangel actually let her come back?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>chel</name></author><summary type="html">You’re just a typical high school student. You’ve got good friends.
