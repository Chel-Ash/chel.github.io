As such, this also results in a high price at which Vr games are sold, and in some cases unaffordable to gamers with conservative pockets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Gaming world, there is always a place for everyone, there always exist that one game that would suit your unique situation perfectly.

If not, then this post is for you were you will get the best free vr games available on steam.&lt;/p&gt;

    Players can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an example). It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport or D-pad controls of most VR games. This includes but is not limited to being able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting any special buttons (all controller angle/position based). It's up to your own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to do in the air. You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling cables.

There has been a sprawl of VR Games released every now and then. Just as it was with mobile games, it also becomes necessary for gamers to choose the absolute best of them in which they can spend money and get the best value. If you are an avid gamer like I am, you would only want to spend time on those games that derive the best satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Hardware for VR Gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our list of vr games covers the top new titles for the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S (the successor to the Oculus Rift), PlayStation VR, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets. Many of these devices (and the games themselves) have gotten cheaper in the past couple of years, which makes them a more easily justifiable purchase. 
Gamers using Headsets like the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S, Valve Index and Windows Mixed Reality has to consider the hardware requirements for them. For the best experience use top-of-the-line-GPUs mounted on powerful gaming desktops or VR-ready laptops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a few sources, reviews, gaming know-how and having actually tested a few of these games, I decided to conjure in a top ten list the best vr games for August 2020. You can find links leading to where you can find them.
Do you have any favorite VR titles that didn’t make the list or disagree with any of our choices? Send in your top picks. We’ll update this story from time to time, so your choice could appear in the next update.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;A trippy, exhilarating voxel arcade shooter specifically engineered to take you to a happy, tranced-out pleasure zone full of deer and mushrooms.

Back in 1994 we created one of the first examples of a new genre of arcade gaming: the trance shooter, with &quot;Tempest 2000&quot; on the Atari Jaguar.

Since then we have been creating software - both games and visualisers - with the specific intent to create in its users a euphoric experience, something that players will return to again and again simply because the act of playing feels so good.

Memorable milestones along the way include the Virtual Light Machine lightsynths, the Xbox 360 music visualiser, and games such as Space Giraffe, Gridrunner Revolution, Polybius and the Minotaur Arcade games.

In recent years we have been bringing these experiences to the world of VR too. Head-mounted displays are in everyone's future, and we now make everything we create playable in or out of VR as a matter of course. Immersion via a VR headset makes the mood-enhancing, euphoric nature of our games even more effective.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Zooma is a virtual adventure in which you will have to be smart, demonstrate your ability for rapid decision-making, and exhibit significant accuracy and coordination skills.
	Check out what happens if you mix shooting, puzzles, and classic match-three in virtual reality.
	Zooma is not a mere blast-as-many-as-you-can first-person shooter: strategy and speed are essential in this game, so you will have to carefully think your moves through and adjust tactics from level to level.
    	&lt;ul&gt;
    		&lt;ol&gt;
    			How to Play:
    			&lt;li&gt;Choose a level and shoot the rolling balls to match all the color sequences before they reach the snapdragon; once a ball reaches the snapdragon, the rest follow and a level is lost;&lt;/li&gt;
    			&lt;li&gt;Shoot with both hands which will help you match the colors faster&lt;/li&gt;
    			&lt;li&gt;Plan your actions, get bonus points by making combos, and finish the chapters on time to score for more&lt;/li&gt;

    You are trapped in a wheelchair, unable to move anything other than your head.
	This might sound like a less interactive experience, yet this decision in game design makes the experience even more claustrophobic.
	The VR experience is designed to adapt to user reactions and actions. Even though there are no active game objects to interact with, events are depended on head movements, speeds and viewing angles. Sound, noise, shadows, explosions and lights distract viewers and help guide their views in certain directions.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;card-text&quot;&gt;Emergence is an awe-inspiring VR open-world art experience, visualising patterns of human behaviour and exploring the individual and the collective. It immerses the player in a crowd of thousands, against a changing canvas that is at varying points wondrous and intimidating, realistic and fantastical.

You control one solitary, glowing avatar amongst a mass of autonomous strangers, each of whose movements react to your own. As your pace and directions influence others as both individuals and as a whole, you essentially become the choreographer of the crowd.

The crowd’s movements are programmed to simulate intelligent behaviours (including avoidance, following and mimicry), reflecting the seemingly endless ways that humans act in group settings. Viewed from above, these movements create mesmerising patterns against the landscape. A shaft of light beckons you – each time you reach the light, this landscape shifts, along with its soundtrack, gravity, atmosphere and mode of movement.&lt;/p&gt;
