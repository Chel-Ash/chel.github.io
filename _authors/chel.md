Hello,, I'm Chelsea, I'm the little lady keeping this website running. Also the only content creator here. I developed ChelOvebroard so that I can make it very easy for my subscribers to reach my MOD games. I upload MOD games on a Youtube Channel,every 1 - 2 weeks. As it is, I plan to integrate better entertainment on this website as time goes. <br><br>

Personally, I'm actually way more interested in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and I have a different <a href="https://channelai.netlify.app">website</a> that I write articles on related subjects and topics.<br><br>

While growing up, I had a very strong attraction to games, so I played them a lot. I started to use some MODs to you know, increase my abilities in a game xD. My best android game of all time should be Brawl Stars.. I'm not quite interested in anime games, I only do it currently because overtime the number of Users on my channel increased and most of them depend on me for giving them "<b>working</b>" MODs. I've been told several times by Users that they sought everywhere for a particular MOD game and never found one that worked before coming on to my channel. I think it's great I can do that for others, and I'm glad about it. So yhh,, basically, I enjoy working, spending my time on this website because I can do web-development, improve my skills in them along the way and also get a lot of drive to do more. Without this website, I couldn't be as good as I am right now in general. To a very large extent, it made me become independent, also it taught me so many lessons on hardwork, dedication and definite chief aim.<br><br> 

What are my plans for the future concerning this project?.. Yhh I got a very straight forward answer.. I'm gonna implement an exciting Artificial Intelligence project into it, perhaps like a service or an application, but whatever it is,, AI and Gaming would be the focus. I have some big, scary ideas ofcourse lol. But they need a lot of skill gathering, research, experience, and thinking. Yhh all of those can be achieved, the only issue?, "<em>it takes time</em>", which is why you shouldn't be expecting this innovation to become a realization like next-week xD..<br><br> 

<h5>Some of my interests/hobbies/What I can spend hours on, includes:</h5>


<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
	<li>Reading blog posts on Artificial Intelligence in my areas of interests</li>
	<li>Studying ML in practice - Carrying out ML projects</li>
	<li>Reading Agatha Christie (Strictly Poirot's Murder Books)</li>

	<li>Scrolling Quora feeds and Reading Overwhelming stories</li>
	<li>Playing Games that Involves Strategic Action that ends in one team losing (Brawl Stars, Kaboom)</li>
	<li>A few others that are rather <em>private</em></li>
</ul><br><br>

That's it for now, I might get to add a few more lines if any thing worth sharing comes up. Btw, if you want to connect with me, for anything that I might have an idea about, you can reach me with anyone of the links:
