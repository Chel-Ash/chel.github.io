<h3>Introduction</h3>
Honestly you might have had conflicting opinions and felt unsatisfaction with choices you may have made concerning VR products till now, but that's only normal. As humans, when we are excited about a new trend, we tend to feel every choice we made was the wrong one, we are always looking for the perfect one. In truth, this has been the same with every trend-setting product released till date - Iphone X, Windows Updates, Branded Clothes etc.


<h3>Do you need an Oculus Rift S</h3>
Do you need an Oculus Rift S vr headset now? - Chances are you don't need one. As is the case, gamers feels like they surely do, but this in truth is not always necessary or essential to their needs. I consider myself a gamer, not just that - I'm passionate about experiencing VR gaming. But I can't see myself buying an Oculus Rift S with mine or my parent's money for some important reasons, to find out if you need an oculus rift s, consider these questions below and answer them according to your own situation:

* How many hours do you spend on VR gaming every week? Less than 10 hours and you probably do not
* Can you afford the cost of an Oculus Rift S with you own personal income?
* What do you hope to achieve with an Oculus Rift: Intense game competition, Youtube Let's play videos, VR- game Development
Let's consider the following:
* For Intense Gaming and Youtube Let's play videos, it's possible in every respect to opt for a more affordable headset that would work just as well as gaming on an Oculus headset.
* For vr development, it's not advised to limit your testing headset to an Oculus or better still, as a beginner, Oculus supported games are NOT the best starting point for you.

The conclusion - No matter what use case you want a VR headset for if your budget does not adequately allow for it, an Oculus Rift S is not the best option to consider as other more affordable brands can achieve your goals for you without hassels. That being said, there still exist a lot of options to consider which can prove confusing andd intangible for a noob to comtemplate.

<h3>Features/Essentials of a VR headset</h3>
Before we start, I want to assure you that while surface-discussing the features of a VR headset, I choose to leave the technical details alone on Wikipedia because I assume you fall into the category of Gamer/VR Dev and sincerely just want a straight-forward honest discussion on these terms. Now let's begin


Some essential key point features of VR headset that Brands look to include in their products are:

* Quality: The quality of a VR headset refers to it's rendering power. i.e how fast it is able to play 3D graphics every second. In computing language this is called fps or frames per seconds. One small detail to note: because a vr headset has two viewing angle(providing separate images for each eye), it has to render 2X the graphics of a game whereas a regular PC or gaming device renders just once. As a result, this leads to low quality in some experiences or frame-skipping. Vr headsets also come with gyroscopes, accelerometer and magnetometers, the power of these head-tracking sensors dirctly determines the quality of the headset. Now you know some of the details, it's necessary to check the capacity of a headset so you know what to expect before-hand. Today as technology keeps advancing, VR headsets comapnies are finding it less difficult to equip their product with working quality systems.

* Control: Some VR Headset comes with controllers equipped, this is a device that enables hand-tracking so the player's movement can be simulated in the Vr world. Most games today require a player's movement for interaction within the game, so this is a very important feature. An addition to controllers <i>Haptic feedback</i> is the sense of touch designed to provide information to the end user, is already built into a number of existing virtual reality controllers

* Comfort: Most VR Brands live up comfortably to this particular feature, but certainly when considering low priced headsets you have to consider the comfortability it comes with. In short, 
1. Does the headset feel comfortable to wear for long use
2. Can the strap - if it comes with one, be adjusted or removed for cleaning
3. Does it feel itchy or heavy to put on
These are some questions to consider when checking the comfort that comes with a VR headset.
