<p>You were enjoying a nice hiking trip up in the mountains until you got lost in the woods after a mishap at the peak[..]

Luckily, you stumble upon an old mansion in the woods that's inhabited by three BEAUTIFUL sisters! They offer you a room for the night, but something seems a little bit off about them. Before you know it, you find yourself chained to the wall in a dungeon! It turns out the three girls are vampires and need YOUR blood to gain more power as vampires!<br><br>

Without a choice, you end up being imprisoned in their mansion waiting for the day of the ritual to come. But as you spend more time with them, you begin to realize that there's more to these vampire girls than just blood lust...<br><br>

Could you be the secret to saving them from their fate as vampires...?<br><br>

■Characters■<br><br>

Rosemary - The Mature Older Sister<br><br>

She can seem cold and ruthless, but Rosemary deeply cares for her sisters and wants only the best for them. She doesn’t like you at first, but as you get to know her, she begins to soften up a little.<br><br>

Blair - The Feisty Middle Child<br><br>

She can be aggressive and more than a little abrasive at times, but you soon learn that this may just be an act to hide a much more vulnerable side of herself…<br><br>

Lilith - The Innocent Youngest Sister<br><br>

Lilith is kind-hearted and the least aggressive towards you of the three sisters. She genuinely seems to feel bad about imprisoning you and doesn’t seem all that happy about being a vampire.</p>
