<p>Your parents are set to move to Japan, but you decide return to your hometown on your own after ten years of being away[..]

Some parts of the town have changed; some have not. Ten years ago, you left behind your crying and heartbroken best friend. What will happen when you reunite?<br><br>

The school that you have enrolled in seems normal in the beginning. Two sisters quickly befriend you – one who is spirited and brave and the other who is calm and shy. They let you in on a little secret: not everything in the school is as it seems. The peaceful facade at school is simply hiding the scars and horrors underneath. A tragedy occurred in the school not long ago, and it seems that you have landed in the thick of it.<br><br>

ou are reunited with your childhood friend who has grown into a beautiful girl. This happiness does not last long, though. An innocent excursion to an abandoned school building quickly turns into a living nightmare due to your actions. With bodies piling up and rumors of ghosts haunting the hallways, what can you do to help your school and save your friends? The three beauties might be able to help, but will you have the power to make sure that you all make it out alive…?<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

Chloe<br><br>
“I wasn’t sure you’d remember me, but I’m glad you do. I really missed you…”

Chloe is your childhood friend whom you haven’t seen for a number of years. She has been lonely since you left, but now that you are back, she’s hoping to reconnect. She’s usually sweet, but you are the only one who manages to bring out a myriad of emotions from her. Will you discover what lies deep within her heart?<br><br>

Rita<br><br>
“I’ve seen things, and so will you now that you’re here. I will protect my sister and this school no matter what.”

Rita is the vibrant and passionate girl who befriends you on your first day. She is Anna’s older sister and always does her best to protect her loved ones. She is very brave and follows you into whatever adventure or mystery you find. Will you be able to keep her safe from her own reckless behavior?<br><br>

Anna<br><br>
“I’ll be honest… I’m terrified, but I’m more scared of being alone than I am of helping to find out what is going on.”

Anna is Rita’s younger sister and is a shy and gentle soul. She is often terrified in the face of danger, but she does her best to try and help you solve the mystery surrounding the school. With your help, she might find more confidence. Will you help her to realize that she is brave for facing her fears?</p>
