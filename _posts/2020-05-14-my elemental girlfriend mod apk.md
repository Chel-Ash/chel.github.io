driver speeding towards you is about to bring it all to an end! When you open your eyes, you find… Three cute spirit girls?! Each one of them represents an element and apparently they’ve been forced out of their world until they can collect special stones which they need YOUR help for!<br><br>

Find out in My Elemental Girlfriend!<br><br>

☆Characters☆<br><br>
Laman the Fire Spirit<br><br>
Energetic and always enthusiastic, this fire spirit has a tendency to act before she thinks. She’s been labeled a drop out because she can’t control her massive powers and she feels a sense of inferiority because of this. Will you be the one to help her realize her potential?<br><br>
Udie the Water Spirit<br><br>
Though she can be a little callous at times, Udie is a caring spirit at heart that has trouble expressing her true feelings. She seems fully competent, but she holds a secret as to why she is with the other two dropouts. Will you be able to discover the secrets of her heart?<br><br>

Canon the Earth Spirit<br><br>

Canon is meek and reserved but has a heart of gold. She’s always had trouble controlling her powers and Udie has acted like a big sister to her. She wants desperately to overcome her weaknesses, but will you be able to help her do so?</p>
