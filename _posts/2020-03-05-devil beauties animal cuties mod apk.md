<p>In a world where humans, half-animals, devils, and angels all live alongside each other, your parents’ work has forced you to[..]

transfer to another school.
The only problem is that you’re a human and they don’t allow humans in! With fake ears and a tail you manage to fool the administration, but you soon find yourself befriending an energetic dog, a polite cat, and a feisty devil girl!<br><br>

As your friendships grow stronger and you find yourself enjoying school life, you begin to wonder how long you’ll be able to keep up this act. And you also wonder what they’ll think of you if they were to find out…<br><br>

Can true love between species exist? Find out in Devil Beauty & Animal Cuties!<br><br>

♥Characters♥<br><br>

The Energetic Puppy - Veronica<br><br>
Veronica’s always full of energy and can be a bit of a handful, but she deeply cares about her friends and will always stand up for them! Will this loveable puppy dog be the one that steals your heart?<br><br>

The Shy Feline - Penelope<br><br>
Penelope is shy and more than a little modest when it comes to all things romantic. She’s a bit of an overachiever and comes from a very protective family, but will you be able to help her break out of her shell?<br><br>

The Feisty Devil - Cassandra<br><br>
Cassandra is part devil and is not someone you want to mess with! She’s tough and isn’t afraid to fight anyone that questions her background. But at heart, she’s quite lonely as the only devil around the school… Will she ever open up to you?</p>
