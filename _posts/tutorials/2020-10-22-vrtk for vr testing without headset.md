The aim of this article is to introduc vrtk plugin through simple explanatiuons and to detail the steps required to set it up on your own development machine.


Before we begin, Let's take a better look briefly at what VRTK is and how it aims to simplify building VR functionalities along also enabling Developers without a Proper VR Kit have a chance at Building for VR.

### What is VRTK

VRTK is a collection of useful, reusable solutions to common problems found when building for virtual reality. VRTK aims to help productivity by speeding up the creation process from prototyping ideas to building complete solutions.

From this definition, we can see that this helpul tool can be applied for other use-cases and not just for testing during development process, later in this article, we would breifly cover the main use-cases so you can understand better - what can and can't be done.


### How can it be Used?

The VRTK Unity Plugin brings a whole lot of functionalities in a Drag-and-Drop System. It allows compatibility with a set of popular VR SDks like Oculus Plugin, Steam VR Plugin and even for Open VR. The full list of Compatible Unity VR Plugins with VRTK and their Uses are listed below;

<h3>Install and set up VRTK as a Unity Project</h3>

2. Extract the file to an easily accessible folder on your computer.
3. Open up Unity Hub and select Add, then locate the extracted VRTK folder and finally open it up.

* Before you can use the tool feature, you have to edit the project settings by setting it up for VR; to do that <b>Go to Edit, Project settings, Player, Under XR Settings - Check VR reality supported</b> and Under Other settings <b>Make sure that API Compatibility Level is set to .NET 4</b>

This process can make development work very easy for you even without a headset. Although, you would need to take a few minutes to learn how the control works, but once u've mastered it, this tool can be very effective for testing your virtual reality prototypes.
