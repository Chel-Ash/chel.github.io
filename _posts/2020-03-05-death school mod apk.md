<p>Your life in high school seemed pretty normal. You go to class, study, hang out with friends and generally just do what every[..]

other high school student does. 

But one day, a mysterious and beautiful transfer student joins your class and she says that there’s something evil lurking in your school. You and the others pass it off as just her overactive imagination.<br><br>

The day ends and you’re about to head home when you come to a terrifying discovery… You’re trapped in the school by a mysterious force! Luckily, you’re not alone. Your childhood friend, the head of the literature club you’re a part of and the transfer student have also been trapped in the school. However, you quickly discover that the evil force that is in the school wants you dead…<br><br>

Will you be able to evade deadly traps and escape the curse of a vengeful ghost?<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

The Energetic Leader - Rei<br><br>
Rei’s been your friend for as long as you can remember and though she’s a bit tsundere, you get along with her. She’s a natural-born leader who can take charge of any situation, but she tends to shoulder the burden on her own.<br><br>

The Mysterious Transfer Student - Meiko<br><br>
Meiko has a connection with the supernatural and was the first to notice the evil forces that lurked the hallways of the school. She’s undeniably beautiful, but her eccentric ways have made her a bit of a loner.<br><br>

The Optimistic Bookworm - Natsume<br><br>
Natsume is the head of the literature club that you’re a part of and tends to take life at her own pace. She’s popular amongst the club members and is supportive of her fellow literature fans.</p>
