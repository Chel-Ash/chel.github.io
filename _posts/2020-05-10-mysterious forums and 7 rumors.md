<p>Life’s not easy being the city’s only superhero and it’s even harder when you’ve gotta balance it with high school life! 

But somehow you’ve managed to keep your identity a secret even from your childhood friend who’s a huge fan of your superhero form.<br><br>

That all changes when you rescue a girl from your school who somehow figures out your secret identity! Luckily, she becomes your ally, but you can’t keep your guard down! One of the hottest girls in the school seems to have a grudge against your superhero form and she’s looking for revenge…! Will you be able to balance relationships between three girls, your schoolwork and life as a superhero?! Find out in “Be Her Hero!”<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

The Easygoing Childhood Friend - Luka<br><br>
Luka’s been your friend for as long as you can remember and is a huge fan of “Dark Apostle,” your superhero form! Not wanting to put her in danger, you play dumb around her, but it’s hard to resist the urge to tell her who you really are…<br><br>

The Cool Beauty - Sarah<br><br>
Some might consider Sarah the ice queen, but she’s actually quite friendly once you get to know her! However, she swears that Dark Apostle killed her grandfather and seeks vengeance… Will you be able to convince her otherwise?<br><br>

The Tsundere Sidekick - Maggie<br><br>
Spunky and a little feisty, Maggie becomes your partner after she discovers your secret identity! She has almost superhero-like senses and helps you out on your missions. But maybe she wants to be more than just your sidekick...</p>
