<p>You’ve made your living as an assassin and are well-known throughout the underground for your skill.
One day, you take on what seems[..]

like an easy job. Assassinate three wealthy targets before another organization can get to them. You infiltrate their mansion, ready to complete your mission only to find out the targets are three orphaned sisters that have inherited a fortune…<br><br>
You decide to abandon the mission, but before you can leave, an assassin from another organization attacks! You easily dispatch of the attacker, but the three sisters approach you with an offer.<br><br>

“Will you be our bodyguard?”<br><br>

You don’t usually accept these kinds of offers, but they promise to pay you with all of their fortunes. More than the money, the girls remind you of your long lost sister and you decide to take the offer.<br><br>

Will you be able to protect the sisters…?<br><br>

◆Characters◆<br><br>

Julia - The Mature Oldest Sister<br><br>
The oldest of the three sisters, Julia can come off a little terse at times, but she cares deeply for her sisters and will do anything to protect them. Even use you! She tends to shoulder all of the burdens, but will you help her be able to learn to trust others more?<br><br>

Cindy - The Energetic Second Sister<br><br>
Cindy’s the wild one of the bunch, but she’s not a fan of how Julia always treats her like a child. However, she does hold a secret admiration for her older sister’s sense of responsibility. Can you bridge the gap between the two of them?<br><br>

Katie - The Quiet Youngest Sister<br><br>
Though quiet on the surface, Katie wants to find the murderer of their parents more than anything. She harbors some resentment towards her sisters for not being as proactive about it, but will you decide to help her on her mission?
