<!-- Statistics -->
* On the process of gathering any new skill there are two very important things you should keep in mind: Decision & Action.

If you can't make prompt decision, the action side of things diminishes significantly. And that's not very good because actions makes you achieve goals.

In this blog post I will cover and explain all the necessary areas you should know before getting in vr development for whatever purpose you might have(video games, education, movies, medicine, automobiles).Please Note that, more attention is focused on video games development in vr. Let's begin

These are the steps guiding us through this article:

<h3>What is virtual reality development</h3>
Developers, storytellers, artists, beginners, etc. all have an opportunity to build immersive experiences using an exciting new technology that literally pushes the bounds of content creation.

VR content development is similar to 3D game development in that it the spatial design of a large, immersive 3D worlds that the player/user will traverse on her own. But in truth, it is not similar to 3D game development, there is a wide range of differences between the two like:
* Immersion: The users are placed in a virtual space, cut from the real world on a sensory level. VR headsets allow this by occupying their whole field of vision, while headphones achieve the same results with sounds, thus fully immersing the users in another world.
* Positioning: How is the world positioned relative to the user(player)
* Double Lens: The worlds must be viewed from a double lens headset, how to provision for this
* Interaction: To feel real, a simulated environment should include virtual elements we can interact with: picking up an item, swinging a sword to kill a goblin, breaking a mug, pushing the ignition button of plane in a flight simulator, etc.
* Sensory feedback/Tracking: Vr headsets track the position of the users within a given space so that the computer renders the changes of positions. Users moving their heads or bodies will be given the illusion that they are moving in the virtual world.
In short, a vr world has to meet a few or all the features above for it to be considered immersive.
Keeping that in mind, let's look at how **you** can kickstart career in Virtual reality for whatever your purpose might be.

<h3>10 Essentials to know before starting VR Development</h3>

* <h4>Begin your Technical training</h4>
So you want to start creating VR worlds and certainly you have some ideas on where to start or you don't have at all. Thankfully, there is a small circle of resources available for you to choose from so here it's easier to make a decision. The two main softwares/game engines we have that can accomplish your goals are unity and unreal engine. As a beginner it is recommended to start with unity for these benefits:

    * Unity hasbb a very simple learning curve. You can start making simple games and intercations in a little as a week if you put in enough time, believe me.
    * Unity is free for all to use until you start earning a large sum of money which by then you would have no problems in showing appreciation by paying up.
    * Unity has wide and growing support for other purpose aside from video games like movie production, 3D animation, education, medicine and space. As you can see, there is something for everyone.
    * There is <b>a lot</b> of resources you can use to learn and improve your vr development skill. Unity is dedicated to helping beginners be successful in thier chosen course.

I expect that you have a decision to make unity your development home because it would favour you greatly. About the resources i mentioned, these would help you get started:
