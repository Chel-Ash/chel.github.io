Virtual Reality Gaming is the Latest trend that most gamers are involved in today, and this does not come as a suprise considering the flair and immersion it brings which can not be found in non-vr games. As such, this also results in a high price at which Vr games are sold, and in some cases unaffordable to gamers with conservative pockets. 

In the Gaming world, there is always a place for everyone, there always exist that one game that would suit your unique situation perfectly.

For those that can not afford the high budget of Vr headsets and controllers, know that some VR games can be played without a headset. I will state the requirements for all the games in the list below.

    <p class="card-text">Physics-based VR with full freedom of flight. VR that feels and controls like a real jetpack. A real-time multiplayer VR arena.<br>
    Players can fly and interact with each other online in VR with realistic physics-based controls. The controls are completely VR and natural, just as you would use thruster controllers for a real jetpack (look up Jetman as an example). It's truly free range of motion and natural movement, not the teleport or D-pad controls of most VR games. This includes but is not limited to being able to hover, drift, spin, flip, and burst through the sky without ever hitting any special buttons (all controller angle/position based). It's up to your own imagination what combination of moves or positions you might be able to do in the air. You can even now swing and do hookshots with the new grappling cables.
