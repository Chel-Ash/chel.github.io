Are you searching for exciting new vr games to play this month?

You are frustrated from buying games only to be left unsatisfied because of poor graphics or unexciting story line.

<b>You're are not alone</b>. In truth, That's been the pain of majority of Gamers. It takes time, a lot of it, to search for quality games that are worth playing. 

There are hundreds of reviews for newly released games by blogs and channels, the thruth is that most of them gets a commission for their time. So, you feel like you are always misled continually.


For me, I wanna stick to the facts in this blog posts. Most of my research are on platforms like Steam, Reddit channels and official websites of these VR developers. Youtube is excluded from my list and that's because majority of false information concerning Vr games can be found on youtube Channels. That said, <b>Note</b> that I embed gameplay videos from youtube. This is done only after I have verified the game quality from the other sources mentioned. 


This list comprises newly released Vr titles and those that have not gained enormous popularity yet. I chose to excluded the best VR games like Half-life, Beat Saber etc, because chances are you have heard of these titles, played them, or are yet to. That said, let jump right into the top Vr Games with Hand-Tracking enabled.


<h3>10+ Best Hand-Tracking Vr Games On Oculus</h3>

<p>This is a phychological ghost multiplayer Vr game unlike any ghost vr game you have played till now. It has great graphics which are very realistic. 
<br>
In this game, you can play with your freinds, how fun is that?. The goal is to hunt down ghosts with fancy gadgets and provide evidence of paranomical existence

It is a still a new game with first release on September 24 but it has a huge community and fan-base which are mostly positive in reviews.

The Game supports all the major VR headsets</p>

<h5 style="font-weight: 600;">The Room VR: A Dark Matter</h5>

<p>This game falls in-between mystery and explorer. One outstanding feature is it's graphics. Explore cryptic locations that have been designed with such realism. It also comes with a very good story: You are a detective sent out by The British Institute of Archaeology to investigate the sudden disappearance of an esteemed Egyptologist. 
<br>
If you are interested in investigation and puzzle experiences like me, then you would love this game.
<br>
Another aspect of the game worth mentioning is the smaller fan-base it has. This can be said to be the result of the "genre" of this adventure which I assume most people aren't interested in. But if you are, then you must buy this game. It's wonderful
<br>
One review from Edge magazinge completes my thought about this game:
<p><i>"The Room has never been short of atmosphere, but in VR it’s more enveloping than ever. The quality of the craftsmanship is hard to deny, and what follows is as thrilling a VR experience we’ve had outside City 17, with a finale that blends Lovecraft and Spielberg.”
8/10 – EDGE Magazine"</i></p>

<p>This is kind of an action game(because you fight in it. But not exactly full-time action). It also has some fantasy atmosphere in it. It's a local multiplayer game(you can only play with friends close by). You can play as Giant Overseer or Tiny Challenger and whatever role you pick, you get to win if you defeat you opponent by tracking them down or excaping through the crowds in both cases. 
<br>
It graphics lays around being mysterious,unsettling  and scenic rather than robustness like can be found in Half-Life. If you love Vr games with stelth and intensity then you should absolutely check this out, Like NOW!.
<br>
I haven't personally tried it out, yet. But from the reviews of a game just out on October 8, something fantastic must be going on it.

<h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Karnage Chronicles</h5>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POAGlE7P5HM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Karnage Chronicals is a mystical RPG Action Vr game. I have to give it to them for the graphis, they are legit realistic. You can feel the kind of atmosphere portrayed by just watching a preview of it. So in Karnage, the story is that a the world is ruled by magic and you are tasked with finding a cosmic force and cryptic. It's clearly a magical adventure but the game doesn't let in on that on the title page.
<br>
After watching the preview, the game is awesome. It has humor and funny characters, i think a tiny goblin?
<br>
As such, it has a good community following and positive reviews. It's not a game I would play, I'm not really into action in ancient worlds. If all the elements and features of karnage can be replicated in an action game but with guns, that's my ideal type.
<br>
After watching the preview, what do you think? would you be playing karnage soon? can't make a decision? Let me help; If you like magic, ugly creatures and quests that involves splashing around the gore of creatures! Hmm? Ok, I think you get the point now

<h5 style="font-weight: 600;">Britannic: Patroness of the Mediterranean</h5>

<p>This game is an adventure in the Britannic, sister of the in famous Titanic ship and how it sunk after striking a mine during the First World War. 
<br>
So in case you didn't figure yet, it more like an educational and learning experience, but that's not all. It has detailed information about the Britannic, it's architecture and contributions to the World War.
<br>
Although, it's just an education vr adventure, I was surprised by the amount of Positive ratings which tells that this game has a lot more to offer than just what we see in the preview.
<br>
The Game supports all the major VR headsets exempting Windows Mixed Reality</p>
