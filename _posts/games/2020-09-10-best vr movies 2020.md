That's it, the best Vr movie titles aorund at the moment. Following through with the links, you can observe that most of the movies are very short experience, this is as a result of motion sickness viewers are likely to have. In gaming, this is not a very big problem as in movie production because a gamer controls his/her movement most of the time and can adapt easily to the scene. In movies though, viewers are guided all the way and too much of this can cause motion sickness in some people. Thanks for reading through, I hope this list simplifies your work in searching for vr experiences to enjoy at this time.
