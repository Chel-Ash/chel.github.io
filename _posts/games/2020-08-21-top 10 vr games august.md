There has been a sprawl of VR Games released every now and then. Just as it was with mobile games, it also becomes necessary for gamers to choose the absolute best of them in which they can spend money and get the best value.

<h2>Hardware for VR Gaming</h2>
Our list of vr games covers the top new titles for the HTC Vive, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift S (the successor to the Oculus Rift), PlayStation VR, Valve Index, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.

    <p class="card-text">A trippy, exhilarating voxel arcade shooter specifically engineered to take you to a happy, tranced-out pleasure zone full of deer and mushrooms.

Back in 1994 we created one of the first examples of a new genre of arcade gaming: the trance shooter, with "Tempest 2000" on the Atari Jaguar.

Since then we have been creating software - both games and visualisers - with the specific intent to create in its users a euphoric experience, something that players will return to again and again simply because the act of playing feels so good.

Memorable milestones along the way include the Virtual Light Machine lightsynths, the Xbox 360 music visualiser, and games such as Space Giraffe, Gridrunner Revolution, Polybius and the Minotaur Arcade games.

In recent years we have been bringing these experiences to the world of VR too. Head-mounted displays are in everyone's future, and we now make everything we create playable in or out of VR as a matter of course. Immersion via a VR headset makes the mood-enhancing, euphoric nature of our games even more effective.</p>

    <p class="card-text">A VR Horror Experience. After having checked into a haunted hospital, you are being confronted with its evil resident who is not too pleased about your visit.
    You are trapped in a wheelchair, unable to move anything other than your head.
	This might sound like a less interactive experience, yet this decision in game design makes the experience even more claustrophobic.
	The VR experience is designed to adapt to user reactions and actions. Even though there are no active game objects to interact with, events are depended on head movements, speeds and viewing angles. Sound, noise, shadows, explosions and lights distract viewers and help guide their views in certain directions.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Emergence is an awe-inspiring VR open-world art experience, visualising patterns of human behaviour and exploring the individual and the collective. It immerses the player in a crowd of thousands, against a changing canvas that is at varying points wondrous and intimidating, realistic and fantastical.

You control one solitary, glowing avatar amongst a mass of autonomous strangers, each of whose movements react to your own. As your pace and directions influence others as both individuals and as a whole, you essentially become the choreographer of the crowd.

The crowd’s movements are programmed to simulate intelligent behaviours (including avoidance, following and mimicry), reflecting the seemingly endless ways that humans act in group settings. Viewed from above, these movements create mesmerising patterns against the landscape. A shaft of light beckons you – each time you reach the light, this landscape shifts, along with its soundtrack, gravity, atmosphere and mode of movement.</p>
