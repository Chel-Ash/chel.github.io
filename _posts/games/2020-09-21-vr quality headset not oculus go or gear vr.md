"Virtual reality headsets are only as good as the experiences they offer". If that statement's true, why do the gaming community debate tirelesssly over the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive HMDs. Starting today this shouldn't be the case for you, there are dozens of VR headsets looking to offer you great quality and experience without first cashing out on you. Wanna find out?

<h3>Overview</h3>

* Introduction
* Main targets of this article
* What should you get from a VR headset 
* Quality Headsets to Buy that are not Oculus, HTC, Valve Index or PSVR.

There's much ongoing debate in the gaming community about which VR headset is the best among others. There are thousands of reviews by people looking to change your opinion on which headset to buy, although they do this with a good cause in mind. In reality, this only strenthens the arguments people have and causes much confusion for people like you, and earlier on - me.

This should not at all be the case. Most importantly, you should not alllow yourself to be dragged into this rave because it's expected to continue on for a long time as Facebook(Oculus) and (HTC Vive) release new versions of their headset.

"Virtual reality headsets are only as good as the experiences they offer". I got this statement from PCMag, a reputable website that writes on VR. Certainly, that statement reads true, so why do we all bother with all the arguments and indecisions.

I've played a few VR games till now, geared with the HTC Vive, one thing stands true - if the quality of the game isn't fantastic, you get the same quality regardless of what headset you have on.

I say all this without even considering the enormous price tag on them. It's just pointless considering you can derive the same satisfaction regardless of the headset you use, In fact "quality largely depends on the game".

<h3>Who is this Article mainly for</h3>
This article is for three categories of people:

* You are yet to buy a headset, confused between Oculus, HTC, Valve Index since that seems to be what everyone talks about but "you want something cheaper that fits your budget"

* You have sufficient budget to purcahse a top-priced headset but just like me you are conservative and would consider all options where you can get a decent quality headset that works just like Oculus etc.

* You are an avid gamer, you want something similar to Oculus & co, you are stubborn to not bring your expectation down a bit, also you don't want to spend so much on a vr headset. Trust me on this one, this post is also for you.


Before I introduce some fantastic affordable headsets to you and also to prove the validity and relevance of this article, I want to go through the main components of a VR headset thatmuch people weigh before making a decision to buy or not to. The point of this is to streamline/filter my list to products that meet the required components to a very decent level. I do not hope to delve into the technicalities of these properties, I'm just gonna be using a language gamers understand best.

<h3>Features of a VR Headset</h3>

* Quality: The quality of a VR headset refers to it's rendering power. i.e how fast it is able to play 3D graphics every second. In computing language this is called fps or frames per seconds. One small detail to note: because a vr headset has two viewing angle(providing separate images for each eye), it has to render 2X the graphics of a game whereas a regular PC or gaming device renders just once. As a result, this leads to low quality in some experiences or frame-skipping. Vr headsets also come with gyroscopes, accelerometer and magnetometers, the power of these head-tracking sensors dirctly determines the quality of the headset. Now you know some of the details, it's necessary to check the capacity of a headset so you know what to expect before-hand. Today as technology keeps advancing, VR headsets comapnies are finding it less difficult to equip their product with working quality systems.

* Control: Some VR Headset comes with controllers equipped, this is a device that enables hand-tracking so the player's movement can be simulated in the Vr world. Most games today require a player's movement for interaction within the game, so this is a very important feature. An addition to controllers <i>Haptic feedback</i> is the sense of touch designed to provide information to the end user, is already built into a number of existing virtual reality controllers

These two are the basic features of a vr headset, some headsets don't come with all the sensors and systems mentioned but I make it my business to bring you the best headsets that are affordable and effecient.
We come now to the main content of this post:
