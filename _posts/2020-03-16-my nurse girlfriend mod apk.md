<p>You’re the star player on your school’s soccer team, but an accident during a practice match sends you to the hospital with a broken leg[..]

Seems like a real bummer until you find out you’re in the hospital well-known amongst your friends for having THE hottest nurses in town! Not only do two beautiful nurses become a part of your daily life, but you also befriend a cute fellow patient that’s been in the hospital for a while!<br><br>

Maybe breaking your leg wasn’t that bad of a thing at all!<br><br>

■Characters■<br><br>

The Sexy Older Nurse - Louisa<br><br>
Louisa has a kind heart and is always watching out for you. As the older of the two nurses, she seems like she has a lot of experience… but could looks be deceiving?<br><br>

The Tsundere Nurse - Miki<br><br>
Miki can come off as harsh some times, but rumor has it that she’s just shy… She’s got quite a fan base amongst patients, but will you be the one to unlock the secrets of her heart?<br><br>

The Oddball Patient - Rena<br><br>
Rena’s a fellow patient in the hospital and always handles things in life at her own pace. Will the two of you leave the hospital together as a couple...?<br><br>
