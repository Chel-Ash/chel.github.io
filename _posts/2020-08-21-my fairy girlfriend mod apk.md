<p>Fairies are real, and you better believe it! (They’re really cute too!). You’ve always dreamed of being the star player on your school’s soccer team, but things have never quite gone the way you hoped[..]

On the way home from practice one day, you come across a mysterious box and decide to take it home. When you open it, out pop two beautiful fairy girls who say they’ll make your wish come true! You think it all must be a dream and for the heck of it, you decide to ask to become the star player of the team.<br><br>

Turns out it wasn’t a dream! The two fairies show up, invisible to others, to help you out at practice the next day! Before you know it, you’re on your way to taking your team to the finals! But will you be able to hide your secret from the others? What will the team manager who you have a crush on think…? Will you be able to find your own inner strength?<br><br>

Find out in My Fairy Girlfriend!<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

Airi<br><br>
Mischievous and a little feisty, this fairy has the power to grant you physical strength! She appeared before you along with Sakuya when you opened the box and stays by your side, invisible to others.<br><br>

Sakuya<br><br>
She’s the more mature of the two fairies and has worked alongside Airi for quite some time. She has the power to increase your intellectual abilities and is here to help you make your wish come true!<br><br>

Makoto<br><br>
Makoto’s the manager of the soccer team and the girl you’ve had a crush on for a while. She doesn’t communicate her feelings very much, but she cares deeply about you and the team. Will you be able to tell her that you like her…?</p>
