<p>A series of unfortunate events has forced you to move back to the countryside where you spent your childhood. Sadly, you don’t have many memories of the time you spent there! [..]

Things aren’t all bad, though - Chinatsu and Chifuyu, two adorable sisters at your new school are glad to have you! However, Chinatsu mentions an urban legend of “Ichika’s Mansion,” a supposedly cursed old mansion at the edge of town. You don’t think too much about it, but on the bus home, you have a terrifying dream…
<br><br>

You’re still on the bus… but each of the passengers is labeled with a way of dying and when the bus stops, the first passenger in line is murdered in the way their label states! You wake up thinking it was just a dream, but you hear news of a boy in your school being murdered last night. You take a look at a photo of him and… It’s the boy that was murdered in your dream! It doesn’t take long to realize that this isn’t just a nightmare. Every time you ride the bus, another passenger is murdered and your turn is coming up soon!.<br><br>

Chinatsu and Chifuyu, along with their older sister, Chiharu, explain to you that this is all part of Ichika’s Curse. Anyone who enters the mansion will be cursed by her spirit. But how could you be cursed if you’ve never been to the mansion? It seems Chiharu knows more about your past that she’s willing to disclose...<br><br>

Will you be able to stop the curse before it’s your turn? Will you be able to unlock the secrets of your past? Will you discover who Ichika truly is?<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

Chinatsu<br><br>
Energetic and friendly, Chinatsu is a fan of all things supernatural. She’s the one that first lets you know of the curse and is eager to seek out the truth. She tends to act before she thinks, but will she fall victim to the curse as well…?<br><br>

Chifuyu<br><br>
Chifuyu is Chinatsu’s twin sister and is a little more closed off than her. She’s not a fan of the occult, but tags along anyway because she loves her sister. Will you be able to protect her from becoming another passenger of the cursed bus?<br><br>

Chiharu<br><br>
This mature senpai is Chinatsu and Chifuyu’s older sister and though you don’t remember, she seems to know who you are. She seems determined to solve the mystery of Ichika’s curse, but what could be her motivation…?</p>
