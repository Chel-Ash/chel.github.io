<p>On the surface, you seem to be just an average high school student. But the truth is that you’re one of the deadliest assassins out there! [..]

Your newest mission is to blend into the Ryuho Academy as one of its students and take out the headmaster. Doesn’t sound too difficult, but it turns out that you’re the only guy in the entire school! Still, with a bunch of cute girls interested in you, this mission seems like it’s gonna be pretty good.
<br><br>

However, you soon learn that there’s more to this school than meets the eye. Turns out you’re not the only one trying to take out the headmaster. In fact, it’s an entire school of assassins! You manage to team up with three beautiful assassins each with their own set of skills to try to complete your mission, but it’s not going to be as easy as you thought….<br><br>

Will you be able to survive school life on the deadliest campus in the world? Find out in My Assassin High School<br><br>

❏Characters❏<br><br>

Anzu<br><br>
This assassin is agile and highly skilled with knives and firearms. However, she’s not very good at hiding her feelings and is easily flustered. She’s made many attempts on the headmaster’s life already but has been unsuccessful.<br><br>

Kanako<br><br>
Kanako is a taciturn sniper that is unparalleled in her ability to take out targets from amazing distances. However, her close combat needs some work and she decided to team up with Anzu and Robin to help cover her weakness.<br><br>

Robin<br><br>
Robin may seem harmless and easygoing on the surface, but she’s quicker than just about anyone. Her specialty lies in close quarters combat and she’s an amazingly powerful fighter for her size.</p>
